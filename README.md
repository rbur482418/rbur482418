### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on Tech Elevator's bootcamp. It's a lot of fun so far!
I'm learning formal logic, javaScript, java, and so much more!
Ask me about existential philosophy or metaethics before programming and development questsions.
My pronouns are any/all. I tend to prefer they/it but he/she as well as any neopronouns are fine as well.
Fun fact: everything is a subset of the mind...at least from my perspective.
